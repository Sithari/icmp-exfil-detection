# Zeek ICMP Exfil Detection
This script identifies data exfiltration over the ICMP protocol. It measures odd activities like unmatching echo reply payloads and differing payload contents between echo reply pairs. 

## Background
This is the result of my interest to learn Zeek scripting and also to detect exfiltration of data over a protocol which is unexpected to be used for such. 
This script will detect exfil/tunneling from the following tools:

https://github.com/sensepost/DET

https://github.com/Vidimensional/Icmp-File-Transfer

https://www.phoenixinfosec.com/post/data-exfiltration-with-hping3

https://github.com/ytisf/PyExfil

https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/Egress-Assess


Reference to the IETF's RFC for ICMP:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc792


MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1048
https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/

## Install
zkg install https://github.com/Sithari/icmp-exfil-detection

## How It Works

This script will create a notice.log entry when it identifies one of the following patterns in ICMP traffic:

ICMP_DataExfil, data transfer over icmp exceeding set threshold

ICMP_UnpairedEchoReply, echo reply seen without echo request

ICMP_AsymPayload, payload in icmp req != icmp resp 

ICMP_AsymPayloadFlow, echo + reply in current connection is different than previous


Here is an example output based on the [EgressAssess-sample-2mb-text-file.pcap](https://github.com/Sithari/icmp-exfil-detection/blob/main/pcaps/EgressAssess-sample-2mb-text-file.pcap) created by Rakesh Passa.

## Disclaimer

There exists some tools which use ICMP in a custom matter, for example increment some value within the payload every echo reply. Situations like this can cause the exfil logic to trigger.
